This is a Blazor application I made for my guide on my website tittled "Blazor Authentication & Authorization with Okta and NameBasedAuthorizeViewComponent", 
## About
This is a Blazor application that was made to have okta as a identity provider, It also uses the NameBasedAuthorizeViewComponent nuget I made. It has one page called

## How to setup
If you are going to run it dont forget to add your own okta information in appsetings.json
